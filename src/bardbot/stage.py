Words:

Stage is the base template of a soundscape.
A stage can have multiple scenes. And have all channels used by its scenes.

When a stage is loaded into a group it scenes are also loaded and readied
changes done to a scene presist during group session. Unless saved or reloaded
Stage handles what channels to yield from, based on active scene

Scene is a configured preset of a soundscape.
Different Scenes can have different presets for the same channels.

Channel is base audio channel and plays and controls an audiosegment.
It can be shared / played from different scenes.
It yields 20ms segments to stage based on active scene

Segmenter is a generator that yields 20ms audio slices

Stage has all channels in two collection, active and non active
on scene change channel collections are updated.

Stage segmenter takes 20ms from each channel segmenter

each channel is told be active scene what configurations it is to use.
scene also tells stage which channels are active or not.
